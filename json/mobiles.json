       "description":"If you're after the latest and greatest laptop from Dell, we suggest you look into the 2018 model of the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The headline Touch Bar – a thin OLED display at the top of the keyboard which can be used for any number of things, whether that be auto-suggesting words as you type or offering Touch ID so you can log in with just your fingerprint – is of course included. It's certainly retained Apple's sense of style, but it comes at a cost. This is a pricey machine, so you may want to consider one of the Windows alternatives. But, if you're a steadfast Apple diehard, this is definitely the best laptop for you!",
